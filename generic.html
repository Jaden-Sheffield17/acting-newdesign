						<h1>Method Acting</h1>
						<p>Method Acting is a controversial practice in the field of performance. The core gist of it is this: an actor tries to replicate the life circumstances, mannerisms and emotional feelings of the character he portrays, so as to give realism, legitimacy and dramatic strength to his performance.</p>

                    <h3>How Can I Use Method Acting?</h3>
					<li>An actor playing a character from history might research the character, look for media featuring him, and try to live in the same conditions that that character lived, provided that doing so would not be detrimental to his mental or physical health.</li>
                    
					<li>A character in a deep depression might make him reflect on his own moments of sadness and bring those feelings forth</li>
                    
                    <li>He might gain or lose weight to fit a character who is morphologically different from him, but this is generally frowned upon.</li>
